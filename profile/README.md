# LangExchange - Learning language community

LangExchange is a community application that helps everyone can connect together to talk, share, studyâ€¦ and improve their language skill. 

Innovative features:
- Collaboratively correction: Language text on posts and personal messages (using in chatting app) can be corrected if one in the community sees it is wrong (such as grammar or semantic errors).
- Pronunciation assessment chatbot: helps assess pronunciation performance in almost all kinds of language.
- Vocabulary decks sharing: One can creatively create a vocabulary deck that contains a range of vocabulary in a particular topic. And then, the user has the option to share the deck with the community in which another user can collect it.
- Vocabulary learning: Collected vocabulary decks can be learned later. The learning methodology applied is space repetition using the [https://www.supermemo.com/en](Suppermemo) algorithm, which helps the user to effectively recall a vocabulary card by predicting a suitable time at which the card should appear to recall again in the future. This can be achieved by using a formula that is implied from studying the human brain. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo] (See more).

Common features:
- Write, comment, and share posts on a specific language topic. 
- Chatting together.
- Join a study space with a lot of topics
- Join a live class
- Study vocabulary: Create, collect, and practice
- Constantly tracking user progress in learning vocabulary: We provide users with monthly summaries including information to allow them to know how they are making progress.
